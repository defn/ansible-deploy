# If you use the "git" strategy:
# - you must set a repository (no default)

# - you can set the git ref to deploy (can be a branch, tag or commit hash)

# If you use the "rsync" strategy:
# - you can set a timeout for the synchonize module
project_deploy_synchronize_timeout: 30
# - you can also delete files that don't exist on source after synchronizing
project_deploy_synchronize_delete: false
# - you must set the path to your local source (the default assumes your playbook is located in /ansible/ )

# If you use the "s3" strategy:
# - region of your bucket
project_s3_region: 'eu-west-1'
# - your bucket
project_s3_bucket: 'my-bucket'
# - the path to the file to get

# you do not have to download/sync the entire project on every deploy

#     src: "local-path-to-file"   // <- relative or absolute, just like Ansible

# The shared_children is a list of all files/folders in your project that need to be linked to a path in "{{ project_shared_path }}.
# For example a sessions directory or an uploads folder.. They are created if they don't exist, with the type
# specified in the "type" key (file or directory).
# Example:
# project_shared_children:
#   - path: "/app/sessions"
#     src: "sessions"
#     type: "file" / "directory"  // <- optional, defaults to "directory"
#   - path: "/web/uploads"

# - file: path={{ deploy.new_release_path }}/{{ deploy.unfinished_filename }} state=absent
